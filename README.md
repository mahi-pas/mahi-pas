# Mahi Pasarkar
Hello, my name is Mahi Pasarkar!
From a young age I always wondered how things worked. I would take apart toys to see the gears inside.
This curiosity led me to programming. I made my first text adventure in batch in 5th grade, 
and by high school I was president of Senior Division Computer League!
I'm a rising senior at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 
and I'm dual majoring in Computer Science 
(with a concentration in AI and Data) and 
Games and Simulation Arts and Sciences
