# Mahi Pasarkar
Hello, my name is Mahi Pasarkar!
My goal is to use my skills in computer science to make the world more humane, from making things more accessible, more sustainable, or even simply more fun.  
I'm currently a junior at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and I'm dual majoring in Computer Science and Games and Simulation Arts and Sciences
